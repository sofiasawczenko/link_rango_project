## Overview

The platform aims to reduce food waste by connecting donors (restaurants, individuals, events) with NGOs or people in need. It allows users to offer surplus food for donation, and enables NGOs or individuals in vulnerable situations to find and collect these donations, helping to combat hunger.

## Features

- **Food Donation:** Individuals or establishments can offer surplus food for donation.
- **Donation Pickup:** Users in need or NGOs can find donations nearby and choose to pick them up either by a delivery service or in person.
